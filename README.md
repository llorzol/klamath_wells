# Upper Klamath Basin Well Mapper

This mapper identifies wells that are monitored in the Upper Klamath Basin Oregon and California by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Oregon Water Resources Department (OWRD), and California Department of Water Resources (CDWR). The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has provided funding to the USGS to monitor wells in the Upper Klamath Basin, process of these groundwater measurements, and for maintaining this website. This web page provides access to current and historic groundwater-level data collected by monitoring partners, as well as water-level graphs and maps showing net water-level changes between any two time periods. Data for individual wells showing net water-level changes are filtered to remove measurements taken during active pumping because they do not accurately represent conditions in the aquifer.
