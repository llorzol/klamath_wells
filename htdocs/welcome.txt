     This mapper identifies wells that are monitored in the Upper
     Klamath Basin Oregon and California by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Oregon Water Resources Department (OWRD),
     and California Department of Water Resources (CDWR). The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has provided
     funding to the USGS to monitor wells in the Upper Klamath Basin, process of these groundwater measurements,
     and for maintaining this website.
     This web page provides access to current and historic
     groundwater-level data collected by monitoring partners, as well as water-level graphs and maps showing net
     water-level changes between any two time periods. Data for individual wells showing net water-level changes are
     filtered to remove measurements taken during active pumping because they do not accurately represent
     conditions in the aquifer. For help using the USGS-OWRD interactive web page, click the about button 
  (found in the upper right) and a text window will appear with options describing web page features.
