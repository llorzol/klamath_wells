 <b>Monitoring Agency</b>
 <div>
  To view a subset of sites on the map that have been measurement by all the agencies or one of agencies:
  USGS, OWRD, CDWR. <b>This tool selects from only those sites visible 
  on the map.</b>
  <ul>
   <li><b>USGS - United States Geological Survey</b></li>
   <li><b>OWRD - Oregon Water Resources Department</b></li>
   <li><b>CDWR - California Department of Water Resources</b></li>

  Markers that fit the filter criteria will be plotted on the map and displayed in the tables below the map.

 <b>Monitoring Status</b>
 <div>
  To view a subset of sites on the map that have been measured within the last year - active, or have NOT
  been measured within the last year - inactive, or measured at least once - all by one or more of the
  agencies: USGS, OWRD, CDWR. <b>This tool selects from only those sites visible 
  on the map.</b>
  <ul>
   <li><b>All wells</b> - Any well measured at least once</li>
   <li><b>All active wells</b> - Any well measured at least once within the last year</li>
   <li><b>All inactive wells</b> - Any well NOT measured at least once within the last year</li>
   <li><b>All periodic wells</b> - Any well with at least one field measurement</li>
   <li><b>Active periodic wells</b> - Any well with at least one field measurement within the last year</li>
   <li><b>Inactive periodic wells</b> - Any well with no field measurements within the last year</li>
   <li><b>Recorder wells</b> - Any well with on-site automated recording equipment</li>
   <li><b>Active recorder wells</b> - Any well with on-site automated recording equipment with measurements
   recorded within the last year</li>
   <li><b>Inactive recorder wells</b> - Any well with on-site automated recording equipment with no measurements
   recorded within the last year</li>

 <div><b>Groundwater Level Change</b></div>
  <div>
   The change map tool can be accessed by clicking the "Groundwater Level Change" tab in the data 
   tools control. Using the change map tool you can view net groundwater-level changes over a range of time
   periods. Data for individual wells are filtered to remove
   measurements taken during active pumping because they do not
   accurately represent conditions in the aquifer.  <b>This tool selects from only those sites visible 
   on the map.</b>
   <ul>
    <li><b>How to View Groundwater-Level Changes</b>
     <div>
      <p>
       Using the change map tool located to the left of the map, you can view net groundwater-level 
       changes over a range of time periods.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li><b>Time Period</b>
        <p>Use the dropdown menus to select the time period of interest (years and seasons).  
           Clicking on a dropdown menu will toggle the menu open - scroll through options and 
           click the desired option to select it.  Seasons are defined as follows:
         <ul>
          <li>January 1 - March 31</li>
          <li>April 1 - June 31</li>
          <li>July 1 - September 30</li>
          <li>October 1 - December 31</li>
         </ul>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li><b>View Changes</b>
        <p>To view groundwater-level changes, click the "Show Data" button.  If the 
            time period selected is not chronological or does not return data, an alert 
            message will appear on the screen.  If no data is returned, there were no well 
            sites which had data recorded in both of the year/season pairs selected.  Select 
            a different time period and continue.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li><b>Limiting Results</b>
        <p>By default, groundwater-level changes displayed are not limited.  If desired, 
            you can choose to view results greater than a cutoff value. Use the last dropdown 
            menu to select a cutoff value.  When a value is selected, only groundwater-level 
            changes greater than or equal to the selected value will be displayed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li><b>Reset the Map</b>
        <p>To reset the map to the original map state, click the "Reset Map" button.  
            This will remove the current change map results from the map, displaying well 
            information only.

 <b>Site Finder</b>
 <div>
  The site filter may be accessed by clicking on the "Site Finder" tab 
  in the data tools control.  To view a single site on the map that meet 
  a certain criteria, two filtering options are available for both discretely
  and continuously measured data. <b>This tool selects from only those sites visible 
  on the map.</b>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Find Site by Site Number</b>
    <div>USGS site numbers are 9-15 digit numbers that are unique to each site.</div>
    <div>If you know your site number, you may select one site directly from the list.  Station names are visible by hovering the cursor over a site number in the list.</div>
   </li>
   <li><b>Find Site by Station Name</b>
    <div>USGS station name are unique text assigned to each site.</div>
    <div>If you know your station name, you may select one site directly from the list.  Station names are visible by hovering the cursor over a site number in the list.</div>
